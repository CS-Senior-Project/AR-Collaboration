# AR-Collaboration
CS13: AR collaboration for PCB analysis with VR and Zed Mini
Team Members: Carson Pemble, Ryan Miura, Haozhe Li

Required equipment:
HTC/Oculus or any SteamVR supported vr headset equipment
Zed Mini Stereo camera
printed ArUco marker iamges
a PCB board to work with

Set Up Instructions:
1. Clone repo
2. Connect Hardware
3. Set up Unity (2019.2.17f1)
4. Load LoginScene and Run


Troubleshooting:

Controller Input Not Working at all?
Select the “Window” -> “SteamVR Input Live View” and you can see if the controller is registering the input. If it still doesn’t work make sure you have “Steam” open and running on your system. Steam has constant updates and SteamVR must be up to date to work properly.

If Laser ON/OFF is tracking the wrong hand?
Click on the “Right Hand” object and switch the device to 4 (if it is currently 3) or 3 (if it is currently 4). Do the same for the “Left Hand” object.


Thank you for looking into our project.
